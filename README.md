My current project:

Write a multithreaded program that implements the banker's algorithm. Create n threads
that request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant the request only if it
leaves the system in a safe state. It is important that shared data be safe from concurrent
access. To ensure safe access to shared data, you can use mutex locks.

How to run the file:

After downloading the file; compile using "gcc BankersAlgo.c -pthread" and run using "./a.out 7 7 7" where the following no. are used to initialize resource vector.
